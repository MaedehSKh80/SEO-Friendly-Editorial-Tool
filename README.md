# 📝 SEO-Friendly Editorial Dashboard

A lightweight editorial tool designed to simulate **real-world content validation workflows**, focusing on **UX-driven feedback**, **real-time constraints**, and **editorial best practices** — without relying on external JavaScript libraries.

This project reflects hands-on experience with building **interactive writing tools**, similar to internal dashboards used in content teams, blogs, and SEO-focused platforms.

  Track and compare different revisions of an article before publishing.

* **Dark mode**
